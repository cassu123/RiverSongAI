Responsibilities of the Controller in Multi-AI Model Setup
Input Handling and Interpretation: The controller would receive inputs from various sources, such as voice commands, text messages, or other types of data. It would need to interpret the type of input (verbal, text, image, etc.) and its intent to decide which AI model should handle it.

Routing to Appropriate AI Models: Once the input is classified, the controller can route it to the appropriate AI model. For example, if the input is a spoken command, it might be routed to a speech recognition model first, followed by a natural language processing (NLP) model to understand the command. If the input is a text query, it might go directly to the NLP model.

Contextual Decision Making: The controller can maintain context or state, helping it make more informed decisions about which AI model to invoke. For instance, if the input is part of a multi-turn conversation, the controller should keep track of previous interactions to maintain context.

Orchestrating AI Models: The controller would also manage the orchestration of multiple AI models working together. It would handle the flow of data between models, ensuring that outputs from one model can be inputs for another as needed.

Integrating with Other Modules: Beyond just AI model management, the controller would also need to integrate with other system modules like security (to ensure data privacy), resource management (to allocate computational resources effectively), and error handling (to manage failures or unexpected behaviors in AI models).

Future-Proofing the Controller
To ensure that this controller is capable of handling these responsibilities in the future, consider the following during its development:

Modular Design: Make sure the controller is designed modularly so that new AI models or input types can be easily added or swapped out without needing to overhaul the entire system.

Scalability: Design the controller to scale with the increasing number of AI models and input types. It should efficiently manage multiple concurrent processes and data flows.

Flexibility and Configurability: Allow the controller to be configurable so that routing logic and decision-making processes can be adjusted based on evolving needs or new AI capabilities.

Logging and Monitoring: Implement robust logging and monitoring within the controller to track decisions, routes, and performance of the various AI models. This will help in debugging and optimizing the system as it grows.

The controller.py file defines the Controller class, which serves as the central hub for managing different components of a system, routing inputs to appropriate AI models, maintaining context, handling errors, and integrating all the system components.

Key Features and Components
Logging Setup:

The file begins by configuring the logging settings. This ensures that all events, warnings, errors, and information messages are recorded with timestamps, levels of severity, and messages.
Imports:

The necessary Python modules and custom components (Communication, ErrorHandler, ResourceManager, Scheduler, SecurityManager, and Router) are imported. These modules provide essential functionalities such as communication, error handling, resource management, scheduling tasks, and security.
Controller Class:

The Controller class is the core of this module. It integrates various components and manages AI models and routing rules for input processing.
Initialization (__init__ Method):

The __init__ method initializes the Controller class with several components:
Thread Lock (self._lock): Ensures thread safety by preventing race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify shared data.
Components Initialization: Initializes instances of Communication, ErrorHandler, ResourceManager, Scheduler, SecurityManager, and Router.
Context Dictionary (self._context): Maintains the state or context of the system.
Models Dictionary (self._models): Stores the AI models added to the controller.
Routes Dictionary (self._routes): Maintains routing rules that define which model should handle a specific type of input.
A log message is recorded to indicate that the controller has been initialized with all components.
Model Management:

add_model Method: Adds an AI model to the controller. If a model with the same name already exists, it logs a warning and replaces the existing model.
remove_model Method: Removes an AI model from the controller. If the model does not exist, it logs a warning.
Routing Management:

add_route Method: Defines a route for a specific input type (e.g., 'text', 'voice') to an AI model. If the specified model does not exist, it logs an error.
remove_route Method: Removes a route for a specific input type. If the route does not exist, it logs a warning.
Input Processing (process_input Method):

This method processes input by routing it to the appropriate model based on the input type. If a model is found for the input type, the input data is processed using that model, and the response is returned. If an error occurs during processing, it logs the error and handles it. If no route is found for the input type, it logs an error.
Error Handling (_handle_error Method):

This method handles errors that occur during input processing. It logs the error using the ErrorHandler component and can be extended to include additional error handling or recovery logic.
Context Management (update_context Method):

Updates the context or state of the system. The context is stored in a dictionary (self._context), and the method allows adding or updating key-value pairs in this dictionary.
Controller Lifecycle Management:

start Method: Starts the controller by initiating any required components or workflows. Currently, it starts the scheduler.
stop Method: Stops the controller by terminating any ongoing components or workflows. Currently, it stops the scheduler.
Example Usage:

The __main__ block provides an example of how to use the Controller class:
AI models (text_model and voice_model) are defined as placeholder functions.
These models are added to the controller using the add_model method.
Routes are defined for different input types (text and voice) using the add_route method.
The process_input method is used to process different types of input.
The start and stop methods are demonstrated to show how to start and stop the controller.
