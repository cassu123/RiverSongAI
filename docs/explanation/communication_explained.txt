The communication.py module is designed to handle various communication-related tasks for your AI project, River Song. Here's a breakdown of the functionality that it currently provides:

Current Functionality of communication.py
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

ipc_example(queue): Demonstrates basic IPC using a multiprocessing queue. This function waits to receive messages from a queue and logs them. When it receives a "STOP" message, it terminates.
Networking:

start_server(host='localhost', port=8080): Sets up a simple TCP server that listens for incoming connections on a specified host and port. When a client connects, it receives data and sends it back (echo server).
HTTP Requests:

make_request(url): Performs an HTTP GET request to a specified URL and logs the response status. If the request fails, it logs an error.
Class Communication:

__init__(self): Initializes the communication module.
send_message(self, message): Placeholder method for sending messages.
receive_message(self): Placeholder method for receiving messages, currently returns a fixed string.
Goals for Expansion
To ensure the communication.py module is 100% solid and fully functional for its intended purposes, we'll:

Enhance IPC Functionality:

Make IPC more robust and flexible, allowing for different types of messages and error handling.
Improve Networking Capabilities:

Expand the TCP server to handle multiple clients simultaneously and support different protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.).
Refine HTTP Request Handling:

Add more features, like support for different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) and handling JSON data.
Develop Communication Class:

Flesh out methods like send_message and receive_message to handle actual messaging between components or over a network.
